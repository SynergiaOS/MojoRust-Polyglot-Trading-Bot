## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for responsible disclosure:

1. Go to the [Security](https://github.com/SynergiaOS/MojoRust/security) tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

**Benefits:**
- Private disclosure to maintainers only
- Coordinated release timeline
- CVE assignment when applicable
- Public acknowledgment (with your permission)

### Alternative Method: Email

If you prefer email or cannot use GitHub Security Advisories:

**Email:** `security@mojorust.dev` (use PGP encryption for sensitive reports)

**Subject Line:** `[SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability`

**PGP Public Key:**
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP key would go here - to be added when email is set up]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### What to Include

Please provide the following information in your report:

- **Vulnerability Description:** Clear and concise description of the security issue

### Low (Best Effort)

- Documentation errors that could lead to misconfiguration
- Minor security improvements
- Vulnerabilities in non-critical components

## Disclosure Process

### Timeline

1. **Day 0:** Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2:** Initial response and triage by maintainers
3. **Day 3-7:** Vulnerability assessment and fix development
4. **Day 8-14:** Testing and validation of fixes
5. **Day 15-30:** Coordinated disclosure and patch release
6. **Day 30+:** Public disclosure (if reporter agrees)

### Coordinated Disclosure

- We work with reporters to coordinate disclosure timing
- Credit given to reporters (unless anonymity is requested)
- CVE assignment for qualifying vulnerabilities
- Security advisory published on GitHub
- Advance notification to major users/exchanges when applicable

### Security Updates

- Security patches are released ASAP (typically within 7 days for critical issues)
- Backward compatibility is maintained when possible
- Migration guides are provided for breaking changes
- Security updates are clearly marked in release notes

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers

- **Always use the latest version** of the software
- **Enable all security features** including rate limiting and input validation
- **Never commit secrets** to version control (use environment variables or Infisical)
- **Run security scans** regularly: `make validate-secrets`
- **Review this Security Policy** before deployment
- **Use dedicated servers** for trading operations
- **Monitor logs** for unusual activity
- **Implement proper network security** (firewalls, VPN access)

### For Traders

- **Start with paper trading mode** before using real funds
- **Use a dedicated wallet** (never your main wallet)
- **Set conservative risk parameters** and stick to them
- **Monitor for unusual activity** in your trading accounts
- **Keep API keys secure** and rotate them regularly
- **Enable 2FA** on all accounts (Helius, QuickNode, Infisical, exchanges)
- **Use secure network connections** (avoid public WiFi for trading operations)
- **Regular backup** of configuration and wallet files

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Rust cryptographic modules** with memory safety guarantees
- **Rate limiting** via SecurityEngine FFI to prevent API abuse
- **Input validation and sanitization** for all external inputs
- **Encrypted wallet storage** using secure key derivation
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for all trades and configuration changes
- **Circuit breakers** for risk management and loss prevention
- **Secrets scanning** in CI/CD (gitleaks, validate_config.sh)
- **Dependency auditing** (cargo audit, Dependabot)
- **Memory safety** through Mojo's type system and Rust FFI

### Monitoring and Alerting

- **Real-time security monitoring** via Prometheus and Grafana
- **Alert system** (Telegram, Discord, Slack) for security events
- **Sentry error tracking** for immediate vulnerability detection
- **Health check endpoints** for system security status
- **Comprehensive logging** with security event correlation

## Known Security Considerations

### Trading Risks

- **Market volatility** can cause rapid losses
- **API failures** may prevent trade execution at critical moments
- **Network latency** affects execution timing and can lead to slippage
- **Smart contract risks** on Solana DEXes (rug pulls, honeypots)
- **Front-running** and MEV attacks
- **Liquidity risks** in low-liquidity markets

### Technical Risks

- **Mojo is a new language** and may have undiscovered bugs
- **FFI boundary security** between Rust and Mojo code
- **Third-party API dependencies** (Helius, QuickNode, Jupiter)
- **Database security** (TimescaleDB access and encryption)
- **Container security** (Docker, Kubernetes if used)
- **Supply chain attacks** via dependency compromises

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Comprehensive testing** (unit, integration, load) with 70%+ coverage
- **Circuit breakers and risk management** with automatic position closing
- **Monitoring and alerting** (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry)
- **Regular security audits** and penetration testing
- **Dependency updates** and vulnerability scanning
- **Backup and recovery procedures** for critical systems

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

- **GitHub Security Advisories:** Watch repository for security advisories
- **Release Notes:** Security updates mentioned in CHANGELOG.md
- **Security Tags:** GitHub releases marked with security tag
- **Email Notifications:** For critical security updates (subscribe to releases)

### Update Process

1. **Assessment:** Vulnerability assessed and categorized
2. **Development:** Security fix developed and tested
3. **Release:** Security update released with clear documentation
4. **Notification:** Users notified through multiple channels
5. **Verification:** Confirm users have updated (monitor version metrics)
