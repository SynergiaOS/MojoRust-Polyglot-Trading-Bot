## 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### 1.1 Backup Current System

```bash
# Create complete backup
cp -r /home/marcin/Projects/MojoRust /home/marcin/Projects/MojoRust_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Git backup
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before HFT architecture migration"
git tag -a "v1.0-legacy" -m "Legacy architecture backup"
```

### 1.2 Create New Directory Structure

The new structure has already been created for you:

```bash
# Verify new structure exists
tree -L 3 /home/marcin/Projects/MojoRust/
```

Expected structure:
```
mojorust-hft/
├── core/                    # Core HFT Engine
│   ├── data/               # Data pipeline (Rust)
│   ├── execution/          # Order execution (Rust)
│   └── infrastructure/     # Infrastructure (Rust)
├── services/               # Microservices
├── libs/                   # Shared libraries
├── tools/                  # Development tools
├── tests/                  # Comprehensive testing
├── config/                 # Configuration
└── deployments/            # Deployment configs
```

### 1.3 Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Install Rust toolchain
rustup update stable
rustup component add rustfmt clippy

# Install Python 3.11+
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install development dependencies
make dev-setup
```

## 🔄 Phase 2: Core Migration

### 2.1 Migrate Data Pipeline

**From**: `src/` scattered data components
**To**: `core/data/` organized data pipeline

#### Steps:

1. **Move market data handling**:
```bash
# Move existing data files
mv src/solana/websocket.rs core/data/src/feeds/
mv src/data_consumer/ core/data/src/processors/
```

2. **Update imports**:
```rust
// Old
use crate::solana::websocket;

// New
use mojorust_data::feeds::websocket;
```

3. **Configure data pipeline**:
```toml
# config/environments/production.toml
[data_pipeline]
enable_persistence = true
cache_ttl_seconds = 120
max_concurrent_feeds = 50
```

### 2.2 Migrate Execution Engine

**From**: Mixed execution code across `src/`
**To**: `core/execution/` unified execution engine

#### Steps:

1. **Move execution components**:
```bash
mv src/crypto/ core/execution/src/security/
mv src/portfolio/ core/execution/src/risk/
mv rust-modules/src/arbitrage/ core/execution/src/flash_loans/
```

2. **Refactor order execution**:
```rust
// New unified execution interface
use mojorust_execution::{ExecutionEngine, OrderRequest};

let engine = ExecutionEngine::new(config, keypair).await?;
let response = engine.submit_order(order).await?;
```

3. **Update flash loan integration**:
```rust
// New flash loan interface
use mojorust_execution::{FlashLoanRequest, FlashLoanResponse};

let flash_response = engine.submit_flash_loan_arbitrage(request).await?;
```

### 2.3 Migrate Infrastructure

**From**: Scattered configuration and logging
**To**: `core/infrastructure/` unified infrastructure

#### Steps:

1. **Move configuration management**:
```bash
mv src/infisical_manager.rs core/infrastructure/src/config/
```

2. **Setup monitoring**:
```rust
use mojorust_infrastructure::{InfrastructureManager, InfrastructureConfig};

let infra = InfrastructureManager::new(config).await?;
infra.start().await?;
```

## ⚡ Phase 3: Services & Deployment

### 3.1 Create Microservices

#### Data Collector Service
```rust
// services/data_collector/src/main.rs
use mojorust_data::DataPipeline;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let pipeline = DataPipeline::new(config).await?;
    pipeline.start().await?;

    // Run service
    tokio::signal::ctrl_c().await?;
    pipeline.stop().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Execution Engine Service
```rust
// services/execution_engine/src/main.rs
use mojorust_execution::ExecutionEngine;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let engine = ExecutionEngine::new(config, keypair).await?;
    engine.start().await?;

    // Run service with gRPC/HTTP API
    // ... implementation
    Ok(())
}
```

### 3.2 Setup Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
# deployments/Dockerfile
FROM rust:1.75 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY core/ ./core/
COPY libs/ ./libs/
RUN cd core && cargo build --release

FROM debian:bookworm-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates
COPY --from=builder /app/core/target/release/mojorust-trading-bot /usr/local/bin/
EXPOSE 8080 9090
CMD ["mojorust-trading-bot"]
```

### 3.3 Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
# deployments/docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  data-collector:
    build: .
    command: ["mojorust-data-collector"]
    environment:
