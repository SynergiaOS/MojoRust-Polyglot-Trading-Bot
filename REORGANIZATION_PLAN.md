### 🎯 Reorganization Principles

#### 1. **Clear Language Boundaries**
- **Rust**: Performance-critical, safety-critical, system-level code
- **Mojo**: High-performance computing, algorithms, signal processing
- **Python**: Orchestration, API integration, tooling

#### 2. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Data Layer**: Pure data ingestion and processing
- **Strategy Layer**: Business logic and algorithms
- **Execution Layer**: Order execution and risk management
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Monitoring, logging, configuration

#### 3. **Microservices Architecture**
- Each component is independently deployable
- Clear API boundaries between services
- Proper error handling and circuit breakers
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

#### 4. **Professional Development Workflow**
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- CI/CD pipelines
- Configuration management
- Performance monitoring

### 📋 Migration Steps

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Create new directory structure
2. Set up proper build system (Cargo workspaces)
3. Establish configuration management
4. Set up testing framework
5. Create development tooling

#### Phase 2: Core Migration (Week 2-3)
1. Migrate data pipeline to Rust
2. Move strategies to Mojo with proper FFI
3. Refactor execution engine
4. Implement proper risk management
5. Set up monitoring and logging

#### Phase 3: Services & Deployment (Week 4)
1. Split into microservices
2. Implement proper APIs
3. Set up deployment automation
4. Create performance testing
5. Documentation and training
