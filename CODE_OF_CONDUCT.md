### Scope

This code of conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this code of conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the code of conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained
inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards,
including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual,
